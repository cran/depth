Description: Tools for depth functions methodology applied 
        to multivariate analysis. Besides allowing calculation 
        of depth values and depth-based location estimators, the package
        includes functions or drawing contour plots and perspective plots
        of depth functions. Euclidian and spherical depths are supported.
